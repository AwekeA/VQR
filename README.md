# VQR

***Vector Quantile Regression***

### Overview

This is an implementation of Carlier, Chernozhukov and Galichon’s “Vector Quantile Regression” (VQR) 
(Annals of Statistics, 2016). VQR is a multivariate version of the Quantile Regression 
procedure of Koenker and Bassett (1978). It relies on a multivariate extension of the 
notion of quantile via optimal transportation, and a representation of Conditional Vector 
Quantiles by a variational problem.


The code is under active development and should be considered as
`alpha stage' software.
